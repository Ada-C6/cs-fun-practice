# Write a method `mirror` that returns a **new array** doubling the size of a list of integers by appending the mirror image of the original sequence to the end of the list. The mirror image is the same sequence of values in reverse order.
#example if a variable called list stores a sequence of values
# only .length and .times can be used.

# list = [1, 2, 3, 4] and we make the following call:
# mirror(list) then it should return the following values afte.
# [ orginal    | + orginal reversed]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# I want to take the index values of one array
      #[0,1,2,3]
list = [1,2,3,4]

def mirror(list)
  if list ! nil
    list.length = x
    x.times list[x]
    


    # 4
  end
end


hat you want then write in the index numbers for each of the elements above the array.

The problem is really asking you â€œIf the array is 4 elements long, how can you set the 5th element to be the same as the 4th, the 6th to be the same as the 3rd, the 7th the same as the 2nd, etc.?"

Does that help?
